# Military Symbol

This is a lightweight Python module, including a command-line script, to generate NATO APP-6(D) compliant military symbol icons in SVG format. These SVGs can be generated from inputs formatted as NATO SIDCs (Symbol identification codes) or as natural-language names for symbols, i.e. "friendly infantry platoon" or "enemy mortar section." Features supported include:

- Headquarters, task force, mobility, and echelon indicators
- Automatic checking of modifier and entity types for congruence
- Symbol sets to indicate land units and installations, air, space, sea surface, subsurface, signals intelligence, and cyber units, tracks, and activities
- Status indicators in both standard and alternate forms
- Construction of SVGs in light, medium, dark, and unfilled styles

Control measure graphics are not yet implemented.
